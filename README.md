## Machine Learning - Project 1

Understanding the data you are trying to model well is very important. You can apply very sophisticated machine learning methods but if you are not aware of potential issues with the data the further modeling will be difficult. Thus, the aim of this first project is to get a thorough understanding of your data and describe how you expect the data can be used in the later reports.
